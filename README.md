How to execute the model:

I execute the code in Google Colaboratory. Here is the link.

The code and models are placed in Google drive as well. Here is the link.

If you are not using Google drive, please comment out the code block for connecting Google drive and 
change the folder variable before executing. Folder variable should point to the folder you store the 
model files and the testing dataset.

After that click run all and enter ‘3’ for performing testing action only.
